      'Based on the analysis of the wear and tear in Sanjiang, DVO seized on the typical problem of internal loss in Cash Register and put a loss-prevention system online.',
    sanjiang5:
      'One year after the system was put into use in Sanjiang, the fresh food loss in one Sanjiang supermarket dropped from 80,000 per month to 50,000 per month, and the reported loss rate dropped from 9.27% to 4.98%. ',
    sanjiang6:
      'From the above data, it can be seen that after the loss-prevention system has been used, the store losses have been significantly reduced and the enterprise losses have been effectively controlled. The system reduces the workload of the loss prevention personnel and also helps them to quickly locate the problem, creating more value for the enterprise. It is a good helper for managers.',

      'QSMC has grown rapidly with excellent R & D and production capabilities. In just 6 years, the company\'s size has grown from more than 200 people to more than 30,000 people. As there is a huge flow of people during rush hour, the fast passage is required and the entry and exit of employees should be strictly controlled and recorded. The traditional work attendance management method can bring about management vulnerabilities such as punching the clock for others, illegal access, and access by a card.',

Unlike traditional software, which costs money to buy and download, SaaS requires users to rent the software and use it online.
